The ability to grant access to systems is restricted to the administrators of each\nsystem.\nIf any access is required outside the defined role matrix, the business justification for\nsuch an event must be documented.\nFor Rule-based/Ticket-Based access control:\nRequests for users\u2019 accounts and access privileges must be formally documented and\nappropriately approved. Access authorization information for a user must be retained\nfor a minimum amount of time as defined in business, contractual, and legal\nrequirements.\nFor any staff member requiring access to systems/platforms/tools, a request needs to\nbe submitted detailing the specific access being requested.\nThe Acceptable Usage Policy needs to be accepted by an employee before being\ngranted access to systems that contain customer data. This policy outlines\nresponsibilities and commitments regarding the acceptable use of {{COMPANY_NAME}}'s assets.\nIf a {{COMPANY_NAME}} staff member requires access outside of the default for their role or team,\neither they or their managers may request additional access to the administrators of\nthe respective systems.\nWhen granting such access, it shall be limited to the minimum level required to\nperform the intended business operation.\n4.2.2 Management of Privileged Access Rights\n{{COMPANY_NAME}} operates its access management under the principle of least privilege.\nUnder the principle of least privilege, a staff member should only be granted the minimum\nnecessary access to perform their function. Access is considered necessary only when a\n{{COMPANY_NAME}} staff member cannot perform a function or action without that access. If an action can\nbe performed without the requested access, it's not considered necessary. The least\nprivilege is important because it protects {{COMPANY_NAME}} and its customers from unauthorized access\nand configuration changes and in case of an account compromise by limiting access.\nPrivileged access shall be reviewed periodically and revoked immediately when no longer\nrequired.\n4.2.3 Management of Passwords and Secret Authentication Information of Users\nIt is recommended to minimize the use of passwords wherever possible. Please follow the\nguidelines to reduce the reliance on passwords:\nUse a single-sign-on mechanism to authenticate yourself wherever possible. This\navoids the need to create new strong passwords. Please ensure that the\npassword/authentication mechanism for the SSO system is secure.\nUse multi-factor authentication (MFA) techniques to authenticate yourself wherever\npossible. This adds an additional barrier even if the password is compromised.\nWhere passwords are the only way to log into a system, it is recommended to consider the\nbelow security requirements:\nStaff members must use complex passwords, wherever possible, for all of their\naccounts that have access to critical data. A strong password should consist of at least\n8 characters and should contain a combination of alphanumeric + special characters.\nIt is highly recommended that passwords be at least 12 characters for better security.\nPassphrases of at least 16 characters are strongly encouraged wherever feasible.\nIt is strongly recommended against the reuse of passwords that are or were used\nelsewhere, e.g., passwords used for personal accounts. A common way attackers\nobtain access to corporate resources is by using employees\u2019 personal passwords that\nwere obtained in breaches of other services.\nPasswords shall not be reused for at least the last 10 password cycles to ensure\nuniqueness.\nPassword change requirements shall be configured in the system. It is recommended\nto set this duration to 90 days unless MFA is in place, in which case the expiration\nperiod can be extended based on the risk assessment.\n{{COMPANY_NAME}} shall ensure that any password or authentication details stored within systems owned\nand managed by {{COMPANY_NAME}} should be encrypted or masked to avoid exposing such details.\nWhere applicable, passwords shall be stored securely using industry best practices such as\nusing strong hashing algorithms.\nEmployees should never share their passwords with others, even internally, to prevent\nunauthorized access.\nTo safeguard against brute-force attacks, account lockout configurations should be set up. It\nis recommended to configure account lockout after 5 failed login attempts for a period of 15\nminutes and monitor these failed attempts to detect potential unauthorized access.\n4.2.4 Review of Access Rights\nThere shall be a periodic reconciliation of user accounts and the associated rights. The\nreconciliation needs to be performed at least annually.\nA review of access rights must also include a review of privileges assigned to users.\nIt is essential that appropriate actions are taken immediately to remove, disable, or modify\nany irregularities found in the access reconciliation.\n4.2.5 Removal or Adjustment of Access Rights\nEmployment termination or change of roles shall trigger relevant processes for revoking or\namending access rights.\nIf there is a role change, necessary changes/adjustments shall be made so that the user\ndoes not have more rights than required to carry out the new job function.\nThe removal or modification of access rights for terminated {{COMPANY_NAME}} employees or contract staff\nshall be carried out by the relevant administrators.\nRevocation of access shall be completed within a reasonable timeframe of the termination or\nthe role change\n4.2.6 Secure Log-On Procedures\nThe following shall be considered for security when accessing critical systems:\nIf the login is unsuccessful, the error message shall not display which part of the login\ninformation was incorrect.\nLimit the number of unsuccessful log-on attempts.\nPassword shall not be displayed while it is being entered.\nMulti-factor authentication shall be adopted wherever possible.\nUsing an authentication mechanism like single sign-on (SSO) is also recommended\nwherever possible.\nSession Time-Out\nInactive sessions (Application sessions, Administration Sessions, etc.) shall be shut\ndown where feasible after a defined period of inactivity.\nThe intranet site may be exempted from the requirement of session time-out.\nSession time-out requirements shall be implemented for all the critical systems as\nfeasible and applicable.\nRe-authentication may be considered at timed intervals.\n4.2.7 Access Monitoring\nFor all production infrastructure, logging must be enabled to ensure user accountability is\nmaintained in case of any issues. It is recommended to have additional security measures\nlike an intrusion detection/prevention system to detect any unauthorized access."

Examples of such systems include cloud\ninfrastructure providers (like AWS, Azure), version control systems (like Github,\nBitbucket), email providers (like Google Workspace, Microsoft O365), HRMS systems,\netc.\nMonitored Systems - Where integrations are not possible, the critical systems should\nbe added to Sprinto App for tracking and monitoring. Adding such systems to Sprinto\nApp to ensure they are monitored is the responsibility of the Information Security\nOfficer.\nIt is the responsibility of the Information Security Officer to ensure that the roles that can get\naccess to each critical system are configured in the Sprinto App.\n3.2 Access Provisioning\nThe access to {{COMPANY_NAME}} systems should be initiated only after an offer letter, including the terms\nand conditions of employment, has been formally signed by the employee.\nThird-Party access shall be time-bound, reviewed periodically, and restricted to only the\nsystems required to perform the approved activity.\nBy default, all employees get access to systems that are configured to be given to all staff.\nExamples include email providers or internal messaging tools.\nAccess to other systems should be assigned by respective system administrators based on\nthe role matrix defined once the employee has been onboarded.\nUsers who are not configured to have access to a particular system will be automatically\nmonitored and alerted by Sprinto App. It is the responsibility of the Information Security\nOfficer to respond to such alerts and ensure the role matrix is updated or the access is\nremoved.\nFor Integrated systems, the Information Security officer should ensure that User IDs created\nin the systems for each user are tagged to their respective company email IDs in the Sprinto\nApp to ensure users are identified and tracked continuously.\nFor access provisioning of third-party users (consultants, auditors, vendors and suppliers,\netc.) Information Security Officer or Business heads should approve the access. For such\nusers, care should be taken by the system administrator to disable the account after the\nrequirement is over.\n3.3 Management of Privileged Access Rights\nIt is the responsibility of system administrators to ensure that the least privilege principle is\nfollowed when granting access.\nAs a part of access reviews, the Information Security Officer shall take the help of individual\nsystem administrators and business heads to review the privileges assigned to users.\nPrivileged access shall be granted only with documented business justification and approval.\nWhere feasible, privileged access activities shall be logged and monitored.\nEmergy or temperory privilged access shall be time-bound and reviewed post-use.\n3.4 Management of Secret Authentication Information of Users\nWhere possible, SSO and MFA need to be enabled to reduce reliance on passwords.\nFor critical systems that are integrated with the Sprinto App, it is the responsibility of the\nInformation Security Officer to ensure the MFA status for users with access to systems is\nmonitored continuously on the Sprinto App.\nIn case of discrepancies alerted by Sprinto App, the Information Security Officer should\nensure corrective actions are taken immediately.\nFor Monitored Systems, the Information Security Officer should make sure that secure\nlogin/password management is enabled and that the evidence for it is uploaded on the\nSprinto App.\n3.5 Review of Access Rights\nAccess reviews should be carried out once every quarter by the Information Security Officer\nwith help from respective system administrators for all production systems. For non-\nproduction systems, access reviews should be carried out at least annually.\nThe access review for critical systems should be completed within the Sprinto App where\npossible. For all monitored systems, evidence of performing reviews needs to be uploaded\nto the Sprinto App.\nAny corrective action that needs to be taken in case of discrepancies noted should be\ndocumented as a part of the access review activity.\nReview of access rights should also include reviews of privileges assigned to individual\nusers to ensure segregation of duties.\n3.6 Removal or Adjustment of Access Rights\nIn case of any termination or change in role, the HR team should inform the system\nadministrators and respective managers to revoke or modify access.\nOn termination of employment, access revocation from all critical systems should be\ncompleted within three days from the employee\u2019s last working day.\nIn case of a change in role, the HR team should check and ensure that the roles assigned to\nthe employee in Sprinto App/HRMS are valid or if it needs to be updated. They should notify\nrespective administrators and managers immediately to update the access if required. The\nHR team should also notify the Information Security Officer to update the role-based access\nmatrix.\n3.7 User Responsibilities\nUsers are responsible for following the organization\u2019s access control policy and procedure.\nUsers are responsible for keeping their passwords confidential.\nUsers are responsible for changing the passwords whenever there is any indication of\npossible system or password compromise.\nIncidents relating to passwords/personal authentication information sharing should be\nreported via the Employee Portal in the Sprinto App.\nUsers shall not leave their system unattended while logged on. They shall lock the system\neven if they are moving away from the system for a short period of time."

Regular\nreviews and audits should be conducted to identify and securely dispose of data that\nis no longer necessary.\nRequests for deletion will be evaluated for authenticity and legitimacy. For example,\nafter a customer has canceled their contract with {{COMPANY_NAME}} and requested data deletion,\nwe will comply with such a request. However, deletion requests from customers with\nactive contracts may be deemed invalid, as such actions could disrupt services.\nData Deletion Guidelines:\nData deletion is initiated upon the termination of service, the end of the data retention\nperiod as outlined in the customer agreement, or at the customer\u2019s request. Data will\nbe deleted when it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or\nwhen the customer requests deletion, provided that the request complies with our\nevaluation criteria. Deletion will not be executed if it is determined that retention of the\ndata is necessary to fulfill legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, or\nfor legitimate business purposes.\nData will be permanently deleted from cloud storage, databases, and backups using\nsecure deletion protocols (e.g., cryptographic erasure or overwriting techniques) to\nprevent recovery. Data from backup systems will be purged according to the backup\nretention policy agreed upon with the customer. As per the contractual obligations,\none-time export may be shared with the customer in the format agreed.\nAfter the deletion is completed, a confirmation report will be provided to the customer\nupon request. Implementation teams must ensure adherence to the deletion timelines\nas per the customer\u2019s agreement and adherence to legal and regulatory requirements.\nWhen deleting personal data, the company may consider anonymization as an\nalternative where applicable, provided it does not conflict with any local laws or\ncustomer contracts.\nA record of all deletion requests and actions taken shall be maintained for\naccountability and compliance verification purposes.\nAll versions of company policy documentation and older versions will be maintained\nfor at least six years."

Reporting Information Security Events and Incidents\nWhere feasible, monitoring mechanisms are set up in {{COMPANY_NAME}} for proactive monitoring of\nintrusions, attacks, and frauds.\nIncidents at {{COMPANY_NAME}} can be reported in two ways:\nAutomated Threat Detection Services Such as AWS Guard duty - Such services\nmonitor the infrastructure account and workloads for potential threats to the network. It\nshall analyze all relevant logs, including, but not limited to, system, network,\nperformance, and application logs. If any threats or anomalous are detected, the\nfindings will automatically be reported as incidents into a company-managed portal\nwhere they are tracked for investigation.\nStaff Reported incidents \u2013 If any incident or security weakness is observed by\nemployees during the course of operations must be reported. This communication\nportal shall be made available to all employees at all times.\nIn case any employee notices any malicious behavior by a {{COMPANY_NAME}} staff member or partner,\nthey should inform this incident directly to the Information Security Officer or the CEO. In\nsuch cases, they are strongly recommended to not discuss the issue with any other\nemployee.\nA log of all security incidents reported shall always be maintained.\n3.3 Responding to Security Incidents\nAt any given point in time, the On-Call-Engineer (OCE) is the first point of contact and is\nresponsible for addressing the incident. Among other things, their responsibility to identify\nthe severity of the incident as per the definitions below:\nLow-severity Incidents are those that do not require immediate remediation. These\ntypically include a partial service of {{COMPANY_NAME}} being unavailable (for which workarounds\nexist). These do not require someone to be paged or woken up beyond normal work\nhours.\nMedium-severity incidents are similar to Low but could include scenarios like\nsuspicious emails or unusual activity on a staff laptop. Again, these do not require\nimmediate remediation or trigger automatic calls outside work hours. Low and\nmedium-severity incidents usually cover the large majority of incidents found.\nHigh-severity incidents are problems an active security attack has not yet happened\nbut are likely. This includes situations like backdoors, malware, and malicious access\nto business data (e.g. passwords, payment information, vulnerability data, etc.). In\nsuch cases, the Information Security Officer and the Engineering team must be\ninformed, and immediate remediation steps should begin.\nCritical-severity incidents are those where a security attack was successful and\nsomething important was lost (or irreparable damage caused to production services).\nAgain, in such cases, immediate actions need to be taken to limit the damage.\nIt is the responsibility of the on-call engineer to notify the Infra Operations person,\nInformation Security Officer, and any other relevant stakeholder immediately in case of any\nincidents that are classified as \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cCritical\u201d.\n3.4 Incident Response and Resolution\nOnce an incident is reported, a staff member or team will be assigned by the Infra\nOperations person to handle the incident. It is the responsibility of this person or team to\ninvestigate the incident and decide the appropriate response to the incident.\nFor all incidents where there was no data loss or direct impact on the availability of {{COMPANY_NAME}}\u2019s\nservices, the details of the investigation and corrective actions taken shall be documented as\na part of incident closure notes.\nFor critical issues, the response team will follow an iterative response process designed to\ninvestigate, contain the exploitation, remediate the vulnerability, and write post-mortem and\nlessons-learned documents. Further, the following steps will be taken for critical incidents:\nThe ISO/CEO will determine if a lawyer should be involved with attorney-client\nprivilege.\nA staff member or team will be assigned to handle the incident. This person or team\nwill be responsible for limiting the damage of the incident, bringing the system back to\noperational status, and updating the leadership on the status as required.\nThe team should create a timeline of known data related to the incident. The timeline\nshould detail what we know the attacker did and at what times.\nThe team should also recommend long-term mitigations to suggest steps in order to\navoid a similar crisis in the future.\nIn case of security incidents of specific kinds (like loss of data or data theft), the\ncompany leadership shall take steps to communicate with affected customers.\nAll incidents must be promptly communicated by the Information Security Officer to relevant\nstakeholders, including management and affected parties, to ensure timely awareness,\nappropriate response, and effective coordination of incident resolution efforts.\nCommunication should include the nature of the incident, potential impact, response actions\ntaken, and updates on resolution progress.\n3.5 Learning from Critical Incidents\nThe analysis shall be carried out to determine the cause, effect, mitigation, and lessons\nlearned for the Critical Information Security Incidents and shared with the management of\n{{COMPANY_NAME}} and appropriate authorities.\nKnowledge gained from the resolution of such incidents shall be documented and should be\nused to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents in the future and help limit the impact of the\nincident.\nThe analysis should also consider, wherever possible, costs incurred due to information\nsecurity incidents.\nThe output of the analysis shall be used to improve the security posture and to identify\nrecurrence or impact tolerance.\n3.6 Collection of Evidence\nWhere a follow-up action against a person or organization after an information security\nincident involves legal action (either civil or criminal), evidence shall be collected, retained,\nand presented to conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant jurisdiction(s).\nBefore the seriousness/criticality of the incident is realized, due care shall be taken to ensure\nthat necessary evidence/information is not destroyed intentionally or accidentally.\n3.7 Contact with Authorities and Special Interest Groups\nThe Information Security Officer should maintain contact with external authorities, special\ninterest groups, and forums (e.g., law enforcement, Cyber security team, customers) for\ninformation security incidents.\nAs per the applicable regulatory directives, the Information Security Officer should maintain\ncontact with appropriate government authorities and report any incidents observed promptly.\nMembership in special interest groups or forums should be considered as a means to:\nImprove knowledge about best practices and stay up to date with the relevant security\ninformation.\nEnsure the understanding of the information security environment is current and\ncomplete.\nReceive early warnings of alerts, advisories, and patches pertaining to attacks and\nvulnerabilities.\nGain access to specialist information security advice.\nShare and exchange information about new technologies, products, threats, or\nvulnerabilities."

        "body": "3.1. Change Management Procedure\n3.1.1. Use of Version Control Systems\nAll software developed in the service of {{COMPANY_NAME}} or any subdomain of {{COMPANY_NAME}}\u2019s products should\nbe version controlled i.e. the latest version of our software as well as any previous version of\nour software are readily available.\n{{COMPANY_NAME}} uses a decentralized version control system like git for code changes. This allows\nengineers to work on bug fixes, new feature development, and other independent projects\nsimultaneously. Before synchronizing with the central repository, it is recommended that\nengineers work on local branches created from an appropriate version of the central\nrepository. All changes must be tested locally before the changes are deployed to users.\n3.1.2. Initiating Planned Changes\nWhile developing new features in {{COMPANY_NAME}}\u2019s products, it is recommended to start a new feature\nbranch in git. All requirements and specifications of a feature may not be known at the\nbeginning of the development of the feature. One can create new branches of the feature\nbranch to develop sub-features as necessary.\nMost feature branches exist on the local systems of developers working on the feature. They\nneed not be synced with the central, company-wide, repository. However, when a feature is\nconsidered ready to be used by customers, a pull request is created. Any developer or\nsoftware engineer can initiate a pull request.\nAlternatively, for other changes like network changes, it is recommended to be tracked in a\nticketing platform where change its owner, approver, its impact and details steps for rollback\nare well documented\n3.1.3. Approving Planned Changes\nA pull request outlines the differences in code that this feature proposes. A pull request has\nto be reviewed by other peer developers or managers. All pull requests should be reviewed\nand approved by someone who is not the author of the changes. It is recommended (but not\nnecessary) that a pull request be reviewed by someone who has expertise in the area where\nthe changes are proposed.\nSome automated triggers, like tests, can be integrated with pull requests. That is, a pull\nrequest might automatically prompt an automated set of tests to run on the changed code,\nindicating whether it passes some basic safety checks. Other such checks might include\ncode quality, code linting, or code style checks. The results of such checks are\nrecommended to be logged by the change management system.\nA similar approach is recommended in case of using a ticketing system, it should be ensured\nthat every ticket has an owner who raises an approval request to the relevant head\nBefore approving and merging a pull request or ticket, the reviewer checks that all\nprerequisites are met. Typical checks that the reviewer is encouraged to perform are listed\nbelow. Not all items in the list are necessary (depending on the type of change), nor is the\nlist exhaustive. Please use your judgment to determine what is necessary, depending on the\nchange at hand. Below are some questions to ask:\nDoes the proposed change solve the problem it set out to solve? Are all requirements\nfor solving the problem met? If not, were reasonable trade-offs made?\nAre there any unintended consequences of this change to other parts of the system?\nDoes the change adversely affect any related or unrelated user experience?\nAre there any algorithmic or logical errors in the proposed change?\nDoes the proposed change require changes in the environment itself (like adding\nproduction environment variables etc)?\nCould the change create performance issues for itself (or other parts of the system)?\nCould the proposed change be achieved in a more extensible, robust, or less\ndisruptive way?\n3.1.4. Unplanned Changes\nSometimes, it becomes necessary to apply unplanned changes, like hotfixes, to the\nproduction system in order to maintain {{COMPANY_NAME}}\u2019s operational effectiveness. This is usually\ndone to address a situation where the production system is in an undesired state - either\nfrom a customer-experience standpoint (like critical bugs, system-down, etc.) or from a\nsecurity standpoint.\nDepending on the urgency of the fix required, unplanned changes may skip the requirements\nof a peer review/approval. Such requests are peer-reviewed post facto.\nIn such cases, we can create changes in a new branch. For all such cases, the commit\nand/or pull request messages should detail the nature of the issue being fixed as a result of\nthis change. Unplanned changes follow the same process as planned changes (at least one\nreview or approval from someone who is not the author of the change).\nSince we use a version control system, emergency changes can be rolled back if it has\nunintended or undesirable consequences.\n3.2. Backup Procedure\n{{COMPANY_NAME}} shall have a daily full backup configured for all customer data on the Infrastructure\noperated on {{COMPANY_NAME}}.\nThe backup retention period shall be configured to a minimum of 7 days.\nRestoration shall be performed on the backup to ensure that data is readable/accessible.\nThis exercise shall be performed at least once every year.\nThe restoration tests shall be documented. The backup snapshot that was restored shall be\ndocumented along with any sanity checks performed to ensure that the restoration was\nsuccessful.\nRestoration tests shall be performed by the administrators of {{COMPANY_NAME}}\u2019s production\ninfrastructure along with the Information Security Officer.\nIn an unlikely event of a natural or human-induced disaster, a disaster recovery plan needs\nto be in place for the systems to recover from the failure and be up and running. This can be\nachieved in the form of tabletop exercises which must be carried out by the Engineering\nHead and the Information Security Officer.\n3.3. Vulnerability Management Procedure\n{{COMPANY_NAME}} performs various internal vulnerability scans and package monitoring on a constant\nbasis.\nThe Information Security Officer must ensure that {{COMPANY_NAME}} also performs external vulnerability\nscans/penetration tests periodically.\nAll vulnerabilities detected by vulnerability scanners are tracked together along with their\nseverity.\nIt is the responsibility of the Infra operations person to ensure that vulnerabilities are\nremediated by the engineering team within defined SLAs (Process Config page).\nIt is important to track the SLAs for the remediation of vulnerabilities. In case SLA is\nbreached, it is the responsibility of the Information Security Officer along with engineering\nleads to ensure appropriate actions are taken. E.g. If a vulnerability needs more time to\nremediate, ensure that the justification for the same is documented.\nVulnerabilities that are identified through external assessments may also be tracked along\nwith other vulnerabilities for their closure if required.\nThe engineering team addresses the reported vulnerabilities and tracks them to resolution.\nResolution statuses can include (but are not limited to) the following:\nFixed: This means that the reported vulnerability has been fixed via a patch or system\nchanges.\nInaccurate/Incorrect/False-positive: This means that the reported vulnerability has\nbeen thoroughly investigated, but found to be invalid.\nVulnerable but section unused: This means that the reported vulnerability affects parts\nof the codebase/system that are not in use, and consequently the vulnerability is no\nlonger a threat.\nAcceptable risk: This means that the reported vulnerability has been analyzed and\ndeemed to not pose any debilitating risk to the system. This is a rare-case scenario,\nand should only occur when there are extenuating circumstances or extremely high\nremediation costs."

It represents the magnitude of harm expected from a fully materialized threat.\nTypical outcome scenarios for which the impact should be objectively measured are unauthorized\naccess, unauthorized changes to data, unauthorized deletion of data, partial or complete loss of\nsystem availability, etc.\n5.3 Likelihood\nGiven a threat, its likelihood measures the probability that the threat will occur \u201cand\u201d cause\ndamage. Likelihood can be a qualitative description too. It should ideally combine the chance of the\nthreat event being initiated and the chance that an initiated threat results in an adverse impact.\n5.4 Risk Vulnerability\nRisk vulnerability is a measure of the net harmful consequence of a given threat. It is measured by\nconsidering both the likelihood as well as the Impact of the given threat and calculated as below:\nRisk = Impact * Likelihood (where * indicates multiplication)\n5.6 Risk Assessment\nA risk assessment is an exercise of making a list of all possible threats posed to the organization in\nthe context of fulfilling its commitments to its customers and other stakeholders. It also measures\nthe computed risk for each threat using the abovementioned method. Finally, the exercise\nbenchmarks the computed risks against a predetermined acceptable risk level. Those threats\nabove the acceptable level need to be addressed via mitigation measures.\n5.7 Risk Management\nRisk management is the program that implements risk assessment as described above and\nmitigation measures. It includes recognizing threats and risks, analyzing their likelihood and impact,\ntreating and mitigating their outcomes, and monitoring the mitigation measures."

We use a relative measure on a scale of\n0 to 10, where 0 indicates minimal or negligible impact, and 10 indicates the maximum\nimpact.\nFor each threat, the probability or likelihood of occurrence is also computed.

Where a software package\nneeds to be modified, the following points should be considered:\nThe risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised.\nWhether the consent of the vendor should be obtained.\nThe possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates.\nThe impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a result of changes.\nCompatibility with other software in use. If changes are necessary, the original software should be retained, and the changes\napplied to a designated copy.\nA software update management process should be implemented to ensure the most up-to-date approved patches and application\nupdates are installed for all authorized software.\nAll changes should be fully tested, so that they can be reapplied, if necessary, to future software upgrades. If required, the\nmodifications should be tested and validated by an independent evaluation body.\n5.3 Secure Engineering\nSecurity system engineering principles include security at all the architecture layers (business, data, applications, and technology),\nbalancing the need for information security with the need for accessibility.\nNew technology should be analyzed for security risks and the design should be reviewed against known attack patterns.\nSystems should be regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain up to date to address any new potential threats and be scalable.\nSecurity engineering principles should be applied, where applicable, to outsourced information systems through the contracts and other\nbinding agreements between the organization and the third party to whom the organization outsources.\n5.4 Establishing Secure Development Environments\nThe Engineering team should establish and appropriately protect secure development environments for system development and\nintegration efforts that cover the entire system development life cycle.\nA secure development environment includes people, processes, and technology associated with system development and integration.\nEngineering team should assess risks associated with individual Information system development efforts and provide requirements for\nsecure development environments for specific system development efforts, considering:\nSensitivity of data to be processed, stored, and transmitted by the system.\nApplicable external and internal requirements, e.g., regulations or policies.\nSecurity controls already implemented by the {{COMPANY_NAME}} that supports information system development.\nTrustworthiness of personnel working in the environment.\nDegree of outsourcing associated with system development.\nThe need for segregation between different development environments.\nControl of access to the development environment.\nBackups should be stored at secure offsite locations.\nControl over the movement of data from and to the environment."
